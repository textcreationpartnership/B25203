            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>Mrs. <hi>JAMES</hi>'s ADVICE TO THE Citizens of London.</head>
            <p>GEntlemen of this City, to whom I wish both Health and Happiness, and there is not any thing will rejoyce me more than to have you truly happy; which I doubt not but you will obtain, if you will be so wise as to lay by your Animosities, and to implore the Almighty to direct you; for God loves to be sought to in time of trouble: and not to attribute any thing to man that properly belongs to God; for he must have the Glory of his own Works: Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py are the men that makes the Lord their God, and puts their whole trust in Him; for they shall be guided by his Wisdom to do his Will. But I fear many men in this Distracted Time may not consult that Point. But Gentlemen you know that God cannot contradict himself, therefore it is his Will that the KING should be safe; for he hath declared, <hi>Tbat none should touch his Annointed, nor do his Prophets any harm;</hi> and altho the King is gone, yet GOD remains; to whom you are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to pay all Obedience: and if it is his Wisdom to try you, you must not do as the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> did when they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Moses,</hi> make to themselves a Golden Calf, and say, <hi>This is your God, O Israel, that delivered you out of Bondage:</hi> and this thing became a great Sin, because they distrusted God who had delivered them, and trusted in their own handywork; as if he were not able to deliver them still. Let not this be our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, but observe what our Blessed Saviour adviseth us, <hi>That we should render to Caesar the things that are Caesars, and to God the things that are Gods:</hi> so that there is a necessity to be just, while you plead Gods Cause, and who knows but that it was the Will of God, to suffer His Majesty to incline towards <hi>Rome,</hi> that he might be as an Angel to try our Sincerity, and that the Errors of <hi>Rome</hi> might have a Total Overthrow; but the Sincere to be Convinc'd, and the King to be the Happy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of Uniting our Differences; and that God that chang'd <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi>'s Heart, can convince my Soveraign Lord, and make him more Zealous for the Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion than ever he was for <hi>Rome,</hi> which will be your Glory.</p>
            <p>Therefore, if ever you intend to be Happy and prevent Gods Wrath, decline not your Loyalty, for that is able, by Gods blessing, to convince the King, when he shall see your Sincerity; for how was <hi>Saul</hi> over-power'd by <hi>David,</hi> when he cry'd out, <hi>That he was more righteous than himself;</hi> therefore it is every mans duty to be True to his God, his King and Countrey; and have nothing to do with Popery, which the Lord grant. <hi>Amen.</hi>
